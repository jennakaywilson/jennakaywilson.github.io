            As an educator, I intentionally structure my classroom to make students feel capable.
             I push students to see themselves as problem-solvers and creative thinkers. It’s 
             easy for students to seek the easy way out, and many often ask me to complete their 
             projects for them. It always makes me laugh because the point of the assignment is for them 
             to learn, not for me to demonstrate my technical skill. I remind them often that it’s okay if 
             the project is challenging—they are capable of doing hard things.
            <br><br>
            Teaching art is about more than drawing or painting. Art offers opportunities for collaboration 
            and expression that aren’t found in other subjects. I create structure in my classroom to foster 
            an environment where there is room for both discipline and creative play. Classroom management isn’t 
            about control, but about being a trustworthy figure who supports students in succeeding. I build 
            systems that make expectations clear, and I follow through on both positive and negative consequences, 
            ensuring students feel safe and respected. At the same time, my systems leave space for risk-taking and 
            critical thinking.
            <br><br>
            When students ask why I chose teaching, my lighthearted answer is that I like knowing more than other 
            people (a joke that always gets a laugh). But the truth is, teaching has taught me more than any other
            profession could. It forces me to deeply understand the material I teach and pushes me to grow alongside
            my students. I actively seek feedback from students and colleagues to refine my practices and remain 
            open to new ideas. Continuous improvement is essential, not only for my teaching, but for the students
            who will carry this mindset with them.
            <br><br>
            Ultimately, my goal is simple: I want my students to feel capable of tackling any challenge, 
            both in art and in life. Every student should leave my classroom better than when they arrived—whether 
            as artists, thinkers, or people.
