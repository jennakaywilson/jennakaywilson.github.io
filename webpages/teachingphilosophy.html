            When I first started teaching, I had a student who often felt overwhelmed by projects. He would sit, 
            staring at his paper, unsure where to begin. I offered encouragement, broke down instructions, and 
            gave him strategies to start. But I always empowered him to make his own decisions. Over time, his 
            confidence grew. He began coming in early to work on assignments, showing me that he could take 
            ownership of his learning.
            <br><br>
            This experience shaped how I approach my classroom. I structure it to help students feel empowered.
            When they feel overwhelmed or ask me to do tasks for them, I encourage them to see themselves as 
            problem-solvers and creative thinkers. Every student can tackle hard tasks.
            <br><br>
            One area where empowerment comes to life is in the creative process. Art provides a unique space 
            for growth, self-expression, and collaboration. One of my favorite assignments each semester challenges 
            students to try something new. I ask them to quickly create a series of pieces, experimenting with 
            techniques, failure, and collaboration. I provide a rubric with clear expectations—not only for grading, 
            but to ensure students understand my goals for the project.
            <br><br>
            Alongside creative freedom, I believe in the importance of structure. I create an environment where 
            discipline and creative play coexist. Classroom management, for me, means being a dependable presence 
            who supports students through both success and failure. I set clear expectations and follow through with
            consistent consequences—positive and negative—so students feel safe and respected. At the same time, I 
            encourage risk-taking and critical thinking.
            <br><br>
            When students ask why I chose teaching, I joke that it’s because I like knowing more than others. But the 
            truth is, after exploring other career paths, I found teaching because it pushes me to understand my 
            material deeply and grow alongside my students. I actively seek feedback from both students and colleagues 
            to improve my practice and stay open to new ideas.
            <br><br>
            Ultimately, my goal is simple: I want my students to feel confident tackling challenges, both in art and in 
            life. Through structured play, collaboration, and guided practice, every student should leave my classroom 
            better than when they arrived—whether as artists, thinkers, or people.
